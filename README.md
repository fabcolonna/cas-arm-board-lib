## What's this?

This repo aims to be a home-made C library that implements - in a more comprehensive way -  higher level interface for each peripheral introduced in the Computer Architectures course @ PoliTO, to be used in projects for the ARM-based LPC17xx board.

## Status

This library is currently under development. These are the peripherals that will eventually be supported:

- [X] Buttons
- [X] Timers
- [X] RIT & Debouncer
- [X] Power Management
- [X] LEDs
- [ ] Sound System & MIDI Interface
- [ ] Screen (finna be tough)

## Help & Contribution

Please, I need it.
