# CAs ARM board C interface for Peripherals

## What's this?
This repo aims to be a home-made C library that implements - in a more comprehensive way -  higher level interface for each peripheral introduced in the Computer Architectures course @ PoliTO, to be used in projects for the ARM-based LPC17xx board.

## Status

This library is currently under development. These are the peripherals that will eventually be supported:

- [ ] Buttons
- [ ] Timers
- [ ] Sound System & MIDI Interface
- [ ] Screen (finna be tough)

## Help & Contribution

Please, I need it.
